// # Failure semantics
//
// Waiting for waiters that never arrive is a programmer error: the
// awaited goroutines are not calling a blocking clock operation, or
// n is larger than the number that ever will. AwaitWaiters panics
// after a fixed watchdog interval rather than spinning until
// something outside it intervenes.
//
// The interval is generous by design: it bounds goroutines that will
// never register, not slow ones. A legitimate wait completes in
// microseconds — the awaited goroutine only has to reach its first
// blocking clock call — so the watchdog cannot make a correct test
// flaky even on a contended runner, while still firing far inside
// any plausible `go test -timeout`.
//
// Delegating that to the [testing] deadline, as this did previously,
// makes the failure slow, silent, and reported against whichever
// test happened to be running when the process died rather than the
// one that called this. The panic names the count reached and the
// count expected, which is the whole diagnosis.
//
// The bound is real elapsed time, not virtual time. It measures the
// test process's patience with goroutines that will not start, which
// no amount of [Clock.Advance] can affect.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// Safe for concurrent use. The spin holds c.mu only for the length
// of a slice read.

	// the whole interval proving the panic fires.
	//
	// The default lives here rather than in a package-level const so
	// that it sits inside a function body, where it carries a
	// coverage counter and its mutants are therefore reachable.
	//
	// Two seconds, not five. A legitimate registration completes in
	// microseconds, so the margin is still six orders of magnitude —
	// and the panic is an escape hatch whose whole value is arriving
	// EARLY relative to every other deadline in play. Under mutation
	// testing the per-mutant budget is a small multiple of a suite's
	// baseline, and a five-second escape against a six-second budget
	// was a coin flip that made kills flake into timeouts.
