# rfc/

Request for Comments for `core`. Design proposals under discussion,
plus the durable record of proposals that were accepted, rejected, or
withdrawn.

Where ADRs record the decisions `core` has enacted, RFCs record the
debates that produced them.

## Format

```
NNNN-short-name.md
```

- `NNNN` is a zero-padded monotonic counter. Never reused, never
  renumbered, even if the RFC is withdrawn.
- `short-name` is lowercase kebab, ~40 chars max.

## Status values

- `Draft` — author is still writing; not ready for review. PR may not
  be open yet.
- `Review` — open for comment. PR describing the RFC is open;
  reviewers are expected to read and comment.
- `Accepted` — merged as the agreed direction. One or more ADRs
  should follow (or the RFC itself doubles as the ADR for
  single-decision proposals).
- `Rejected` — merged with `status: Rejected`. The decision to reject
  is itself searchable; prevents re-litigating the same bad idea.
- `Withdrawn` — author pulled it before a decision was reached. Stays
  on disk with `status: Withdrawn` and a brief note on why.
- `Superseded` — a newer RFC obsoletes this one. Both stay on disk;
  cross-referenced via frontmatter.

## When to write an RFC

Write an RFC when:

- The proposal changes the contract shape (new interface, breaking
  method signature, new package).
- Multiple plausible approaches deserve side-by-side comparison.
- The change has cross-consumer implications (testkit + thesmos +
  space all have to agree).
- The motivation is load-bearing and will outlive the implementation
  (future contributors need to understand the WHY).

DO NOT write an RFC for:

- Implementation-detail choices inside one package.
- Bug fixes (PR description is enough).
- Naming / typo cleanups.
- Single-decision architectural calls with no credible alternatives
  (write an ADR directly).
- Repository hygiene and tooling changes (just PR them).

## Canonical first RFC

[RFC-0000](0000-rfc-process.md) is the meta-RFC that establishes the
RFC process itself.
